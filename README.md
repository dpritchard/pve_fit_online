# PvE Online

Simple curve fitting for photosynthesis versus irradiance (PvE) curves. 

This application is designed to support undergraduate teaching at the University of Tasmania. It uses, [R][cran], [RStudio][rstudio] and [Shiny][shiny] to present a simplified interface for non-linear curve fitting, with specific applications in algal ecophysiology. It is not intended for use in research applications. For that, please [contact Daniel directly][contact].
